# CodeAlpha_Data_Analytics
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the IMDb Top 250 Movies Dataset, focused on understanding rating distributions, runtime patterns, and decade-wise performance. Using Octoparse for web scraping and Excel-based tools for analysis, the project demonstrates how meaningful insights can be extracted from real-world data without coding intervention.

Through detailed visualization and interpretation, it uncovers key insights about the world’s highest-rated films — including the dominance of the 1990s in average ratings, the prevalence of long-duration films among top performers, and subtle rating declines in more recent decades.
